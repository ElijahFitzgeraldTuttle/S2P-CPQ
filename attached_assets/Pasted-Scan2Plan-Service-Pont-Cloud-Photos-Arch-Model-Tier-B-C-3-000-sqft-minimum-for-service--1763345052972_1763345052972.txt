Scan2Plan Service (Pont Cloud, Photos, Arch Model) - Tier B & C:

3,000 sqft minimum for service


Building type / sqft tier / LoD = Unit price x sqft = [base price]

Risk (Arch): +15% Occupied, +25% Hazardous, +20% No Power

If risk, recalculate [base price] x [R%] = [modified base price]

Calculate travel: Travel = $3/mi Troy or $4/mi Brooklyn (one way) + +$300/scan-day when >75 mi and ≥2 days; 

[modified base price] + [travel price] = [total price]

[total price] / [sqft] = [actual price per sqft]


Scan2Plan Service (Pont Cloud, Photos, Arch Model) - Tier A >50,000 sq ft

Custom [Modeling Quote] from Uppteam

Custom [Scanning Quote] from BuildScan3D

Risk [Scanning Quote]: +07% Occupied, +12% Hazardous, +15% No Power

If risk, recalculate [Scanning Quote] x [R%] = [modified Scanning Quote]

Calculate travel: Travel = $3/mi Troy or $4/mi Brooklyn (one way) + +$300/scan-day when >75 mi and ≥2 days; 

[modified Scanning Quote] + [travel price] = [Total Scanning Quote]

[Modeling Quote] + [Total Scanning Quote] = [Core Costs]

[Core Costs] x 168% (Reg, PM, QC, overhead) = [Modified Core Costs]

[Modified Core Costs] x 140-200% (GM) = [total price]

[total price] / [sqft] = [actual price per sqft]

1.Determine Tier:

Architecture Only
Architecture + Structure / Architecture + MEPF 
Architecture + Structure + MEPF + Grade

2. Determine [sqft band]

3. Find [unit metric]

4. Multiply [unit metric] by [sqft] = [total price]

Under 10 acres (tier B, C): 

Acres / LoD = Unit price x Acres = [total price]

Over 10 acres (tier A): 

Custom [Scanning Quote] from Vendor

 [Scanning Quote]  + [Modeling Cost (Acres / LoD = UppTeam price x Acres)] = [Core Costs]

[Core Costs] x 168% (Reg, PM, QC, overhead) = [Modified Core Costs]

[Modified Core Costs] x 140% - 200% (GM) = [total price]

[total price] / [acres] = [actual price per acre]
