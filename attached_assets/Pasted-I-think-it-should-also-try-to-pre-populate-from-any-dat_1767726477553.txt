I think it should also try to pre-populate from any data that we have gathered in the scoping panel, but only where it's really easy and makes sense. I don't want to break the CPQ, but the idea is that we can streamline and accelerate the process. Of scoping and quoting and the user experience for the CEO.

Great idea! Let me check what scoping data we have on leads and add those fields to the CPQ prefill:

We have great scoping data available. Let me update the CPQ integration to pass these fields:

I've updated our side to pass all the scoping data. Here's the updated prompt for the CPQ Replit Agent:

Handle additional scoping data from Scan2Plan-OS

Scan2Plan-OS now sends these additional fields when opening the CPQ. Map them to your form fields where they make sense:

URL Parameters / postMessage data being sent:

Parameter	Description	CPQ Form Field
leadId	Deal ID for sync	Store for API callback
company	Client name	clientName
project	Project name	projectName
address	Project address	projectAddress
buildingType	e.g. "Commercial / Office", "Warehouse"	typeOfBuilding or building type selector
sqft	Square footage (number)	Total sqft or area input
scope	e.g. "Interior Only", "Exterior Only", "Full Building"	Scope selector if applicable
disciplines	e.g. "Architecture (LOD 300), MEPF (LOD 300)"	Discipline checkboxes
contactName	Primary contact name	Account contact field
contactEmail	Contact email	Contact email field
contactPhone	Contact phone	Contact phone field
dispatchLocation	e.g. "Brooklyn, NY"	Dispatch location selector
distance	Miles from dispatch (number)	Distance field
Implementation notes:

Only prefill fields that have a direct match in your form
Don't break existing functionality - if a field doesn't map cleanly, skip it
For disciplines, you may need to parse the string to check appropriate checkboxes
For buildingType, match against your building type options
Example parsing for disciplines:

if (disciplines) {
  const hasArch = disciplines.toLowerCase().includes('architecture');
  const hasMepf = disciplines.toLowerCase().includes('mepf');
  // Set your discipline checkboxes accordingly
}
This will let the CEO's scoping work flow directly into quote generation, saving time and reducing re-entry errors.

Checkpoint made
Add more scoping details to the quoting tool for faster estimates
