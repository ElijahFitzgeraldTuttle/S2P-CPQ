# Scan2Plan BIM Pricing Calculator

## Overview

A professional web-based pricing calculator for Scan-to-BIM (Building Information Modeling) services. The application enables users to generate detailed quotes for architectural scanning and modeling projects through either a quick quote calculator or a comprehensive scoping form. The system calculates pricing based on building types, square footage tiers (or acreage for landscape projects), disciplines (Architecture, Structure, MEPF, Site/Topography), Level of Detail (LoD), risk factors, travel costs, and additional services. Built as a B2B utility tool with emphasis on data organization, clarity, and efficient quote generation.

## Recent Changes

### Stateless Pricing Calculation API (January 2026)
- Created `/api/pricing/calculate` endpoint for CRM-driven pricing calculations
- CPQ now functions as a pure pricing engine - CRM sends questionnaire data, CPQ returns pricing breakdown
- Request schema includes: areas (with building types, sqft, disciplines, LoDs), risks, travel info, services, payment terms
- Response includes: total client price, upteam costs, gross margin, detailed line items, subtotals by category, integrity flags
- All pricing logic from UI now accessible via API for CRM integration
- API secured with Bearer token authentication using `CPQ_API_KEY`
- Zod schemas in `shared/schema.ts`: `pricingCalculationRequestSchema`, `pricingCalculationResponseSchema`

### Bi-Directional CRM Integration (January 2026)
- Implemented full bi-directional API integration between CPQ and external CRM (Scan2Plan-OS)
- Added `returnUrl` parameter handling in Calculator for navigation back to CRM
- Created "Back to CRM" breadcrumb link when navigating from CRM with returnUrl parameter
- "View in CRM" button on homepage quote cards for quotes linked to CRM leads
- New API endpoints for CPQ→CRM communication:
  - GET `/api/leads/:id` - Fetch lead details from CRM to pre-populate quote form
  - POST `/api/quotes/:id/sync-to-crm` - Send complete quote data to CRM webhook
  - POST `/api/pricing/calculate` - Stateless pricing calculation (secured with CPQ_API_KEY)
- Existing CRM→CPQ endpoints (secured with CPQ_API_KEY):

### Integrity Auditor Implementation (January 2026)
- Added quote integrity validation system to enforce business rules before finalization
- Created PRICING_GUARDRAILS.json configuration file with 6 validation checks:
  - Margin floor (45% minimum gross margin, 50% warning threshold)
  - Travel rules (fly-out projects require travel cost)
  - LoD premiums (verify LoD 350 pricing applied)
  - Scan duration logic (sqft vs estimated time validation)
  - Historical pricing comparison (15% warning, 30% block variance)
  - Square footage verification against past scans
- Added database schema: integrityStatus, integrityFlags, requiresOverride, overrideApproved columns to quotes table
- Created audit_exceptions table for tracking override requests
- Created projects_actuals table for storing actual scan sqft data
- Built IntegrityAuditor middleware with structured AuditReport (status: pass/warning/blocked)
- Added API endpoints:
  - POST /api/quotes/:id/audit - Run integrity audit
  - POST /api/quotes/:id/integrity/override - Request exception
  - GET /api/quotes/:id/integrity/overrides - Get override requests
  - PATCH /api/integrity/overrides/:id - Approve/reject override
  - GET /api/integrity/overrides/pending - Admin view of pending overrides
- Created IntegrityAuditPanel component displaying audit status, flags, and override request flow
- Export buttons (PDF, PandaDoc, QBO CSV) are disabled when quote is blocked and override not approved

### Admin Pricing Parameters Implementation (November 2025)
- Integrated database-driven pricing parameters for all configurable system values
- Added API endpoints `/api/pricing-parameters` (GET) and `/api/pricing-parameters/:id` (PATCH)
- Implemented type-aware validation: numeric validation for 'number'/'percentage' types, text pass-through for future text parameters
- Added Promise.allSettled error handling for multi-parameter saves with aggregate success/failure reporting
- Created PARAMETER_LABELS mapping for display names and CATEGORY_TITLES for grouping
- Parameters organized into 6 categories: Risk Premiums, Travel Costs, Scope Discounts, Additional Services, Payment Terms, General
- End-to-end type preservation: database stores as text, API returns numbers for numeric types and strings for text types
- Admin UI dynamically groups 33 parameters by category with real-time React Query cache invalidation
- Robust error handling with detailed user feedback for full success, partial save, and full failure scenarios
- Server-side validation returns 400 with parameter-specific error messages for invalid inputs

### Upteam Pricing Database Integration (November 2025)
- Integrated upteam pricing matrix from database for accurate internal vendor cost calculations
- Added API endpoint `/api/upteam-pricing-matrix` to fetch upteam pricing rates
- Created `getUpteamPricingRate()` function to look up rates by building type, area tier, discipline, and LoD
- Updated cost calculation logic to use actual upteam rates from database instead of simple 0.65 multiplier
- Applied scope discounts proportionally to both client pricing and upteam costs
- Fallback to 0.65 multiplier for special cases (landscape, ACT, Matterport) and when database rate not found
- Cost Summary now displays actual vendor costs from database for accurate profit margin calculations

### Account Contact Fields Enhancement (November 2025)
- Added dedicated email and phone fields under Account Contact in Contacts & Communication section
- Contact information now displays in structured format: name, email, and phone on separate lines
- Enhanced data organization for better CRM integration and client communication

### Landscape Pricing Implementation (November 2025)
- Added two landscape building types: "Built Landscape" (14) and "Natural Landscape" (15)
- Landscape areas use per-acre pricing instead of per-square-foot pricing
- Simplified UI for landscape: shows only LoD dropdown (no disciplines menu)
- Acreage is automatically converted to square feet (43,560 sqft per acre) for display and aggregate calculations
- Pricing calculation uses tiered per-acre rates based on acreage ranges and LoD
- Hardcoded landscape pricing rates (temporary until pricing matrix database is updated):
  - Built Landscape: $875-$1,250/acre (up to 5 acres, LoD 200-350)
  - Natural Landscape: $625-$1,000/acre (up to 5 acres, LoD 200-350)
  - Additional tiers for 5-20, 20-50, 50+, and 100+ acres with decreasing rates
- Landscape areas auto-initialize with "site" discipline and LoD 300 default
